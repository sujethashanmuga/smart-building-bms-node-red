# smart-building-bms-node-red
Developed an IoT-based Smart Building Automation System that monitors temperature, ambient light, and human presence using Arduino sensors, and visualizes real-time data through a Node-RED dashboard. Implemented automated control logic for lighting and fan/HVAC operations based on environmental conditions, with manual override functionality.
